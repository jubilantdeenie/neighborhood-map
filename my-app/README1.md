## Project Overview 

    Art Scene PDX is a neighborhood map app created in completion of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree coursework. It uses Google Maps and Foursquare APIs to locate and dynamically display data on Pearl District art galleries in Portland, Oregon. 

    This project was created using react-google-maps. It is viewable across all browsers. It integrated aria labels and navigates focus for improved accessibility. 
    
    A service worker is included, to be implemented only in the production build. To start the service worker, run `npm run build` then `serve -s build` and `navigate to localhost:5000`.


## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
