## Project Overview 

    Art Scene PDX is a neighborhood map app created in completion of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree coursework. It uses Google Maps and Foursquare APIs to locate and dynamically display data on Pearl District art galleries in Portland, Oregon. 

    This project was created using react-google-maps. It integrated aria labels and navigates focus for improved accessibility. It is viewable across all browsers. 
    
    A service worker is included, to be implemented only in the production build. To start the service worker, run `npm run build` then `serve -s build` and `navigate to localhost:5000`.


## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* view hosted on github at artscenePDX.github.io

--OR--

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

Udacity offers an excellent resource list for this assigment. All of the walkthroughs listed here were sourced for earlier versions of the app, although no direct references remain in the final code.

## Future developments

    Later iterations of this project will include all the galleries that participate in the Pearl District's "First Thursday" event, as well as info on the currently featured show.
